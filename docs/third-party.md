# Open-source projects it is built on

usage-control is MIT licensed and stands on the open-source projects below. The exact versions are in `backend/go.mod`, `frontend/package-lock.json`, the `Dockerfile` and the workflows in `.github/workflows`.

## License notices

Every build carries the license texts of the code compiled into it, and its website serves them:

- `http://<device>:9393/3rdpartylicenses.txt`: the packages bundled into the website, written by the Angular build.
- `http://<device>:9393/go-licenses.txt`: the Go standard library and every Go module compiled into the programs, written by `backend/cmd/licenses` in the Docker build and the Linux and Windows release workflows. CI runs it on every pull request, so a new module without a license file is caught before a release.

A device started with `DATA_ONLY=true` serves no website, but its program still holds both files.
